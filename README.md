## What is Morse Code? 
Morse code is the method to transmit the text in form of clicks or on-off tones, which can be translated by the person at the receiver end. It is named after Samuel F.B. Morse, an inventor of telegraph. The Morse code signals contains sequence of sounds of short and long signals called as dots(.) and dashes(_).

In this we have used the zero(0) as dot(.) and one(1) as dash(_), in order to complete the given below task: 

Task1: Building a Dictionary of Morse Code 

Task2: Reading Morse Code Sequences 

Task3: Decoding Morse Code Sequences 

Task4: Counting the total Decoded Characters and total number of words used with count of punctuation.
